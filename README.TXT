This is simple Application designed using Visual Studio 2010

The App reads directory for PDF files(the files which have .pdf extension). And stamping(adding layer) this files on top left corner with the name of the PDF and the page number.
I've a progress bar, which let You watch the stamping progress. I use iTextSharp.dll(http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/) library.
